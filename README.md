# Topic-Modeling-using-LDA
This repository contains end-to-end Topic Modeling Project using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 
Sci-kit learn libraries have been used here to perform machine learning for the Python programming language. 
Sci-kit learn features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means etc., and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. 
Topic Modeling is an unsupervised Machine Learning Technique and the goal is to group different set of documents to a set of topics based on similarity. 
Libraries used are Pandas, Sklearn.feature_extraction, Matplotlib, Numpy, Re and Nltk.  

For this project, Consumer_complaints_dataset has been used from Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB) for the past 3 years.
