This company NOR did the original creditor sent me anything in writing regarding this debt. Despite my multiple attempts to contact them and asking for the details on what or how I owed them anything.\\n\\nI disputed the account with all the three of the major credit bureaus and XXXX \" verified '' the debt. I filed a complaint with the CFPB ( XXXX-XXXX  ) and the company basically told on themselves when they included two attachments in their response. I was never sent anything in writing to verify the debt, despite asking for it in writing and calling the original creditor repeatedly to obtain it. Instead it was reported on my bureau and to date, XX/XX/2020, I still have NOT received anything in writing. \\n\\n1. ) The first attachment was the supposed letter they sent to me. It was sent to their own address, not to my forwarding address.\\n\\n2. ) Second, they sent the rental lease, the lease creation date is recent and not covering the time period, which shows they just generated the lease. \\n\\nThe letter wasn't mailed to my forwarding address nor to the old rental address with the apartment number included which would have allowed the mail to be forwarded to me successfully. Instead they simply mailed the notice to themselves and then sent the account to collections after returning my payment.

Please reference my previous compliant ID XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. \\n\\nIn CNB 's responded letter date on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, all those letters did not provide the evidence that I received the gift cards, and didnt provide the full gift card numbers. \\n\\nI didn't receive the gift card that ordered from CNB until today.\\n\\nFrom the gift card transitions records, it is obvious that both gift cards were not delivered to me.\\n\\nPlease CNB answer the following questions : Did CNB provide the shipping tracking number?\\n\\nCan CNB provide the my signature for the package delivered?\\n\\nCan CNB provide the evidence that I received the gift cards?\\n\\nDid CNB provide the gift card full number to me?\\n\\nDid CNB provide the protection for the gift card activate?\\n\\nCan you report your gift card lost or stolen just using last 4 digits gift card numbers?\\n\\nCNB has to be responsible for the gift card lost or stolen.

              "2  I have been working on completing a short sale with my servicer, PHH mortgage. On XX/XX/XXXX, I have faxed and emailed in the following documents - PHH SHORT SALE APPLICATION, THIRD PARTY AUTHORIZATION, REQUEST FOR MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE, HARDSHIP LETTER, 4506 T, BORROWERS FINANCIALS, REALTOR LISTING AGREEMENT, BUYERS PURCHASE AGREEMENT, BUYERS PROOF OF FUNDS, BUYERS CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION, HUD1 / SETTLEMENT STATEMENT. - After submitting the application I have been calling them at least once sometimes twice a week to make sure they have everything they need and to be as efficient as possible to avoid delays. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and was told there was a Foreclosure Sale Date for XX/XX/XXXX - Docs were received - more information is required - still requiring One more pay stub. On XX/XX/XXXX I faxed and emailed a copy of the most recent Pay Stub requested. On XX/XX/XXXX the package was still showing incomplete due to the missing pay stub. As of XX/XX/XXXX, PHH still did not see the pay stub imaged into their system. I immediately resent to the email address of XXXX and fax number of XXXX. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the pay stub was received and the foreclosure date was suspended. on XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke w/ PHH and was told I need to provide XXXX pay stub that reflects the year to date income or the most recent bank statement from 2nd employer. I then Faxed and Emailed the following PAY STUB FROM OTHER EMPLOYER on XX/XX/XXXX. I called PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmed the pay stub was received and under review. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH for an update and was told we have a complete package under review for loan mod before we go into short sale and to allow up to 30 days for a decision. Called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and the file was still under review. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the file was still under review. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the file was still under review. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the file was still under review for a decision and to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX as this will be the 30 day of the review. I called PHH again on XX/XX/XXXX and there was no new info. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and was told that the load mod decision was denied and that we would be moving into short sale review. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and there was no movement or no new info on the loan being reviewed for short sale. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and was told we need the following items - Need a completed Hardship Affidavit - also a copy of buyers member docs, a copy of the HUD1 w/o cash from or to the seller. HOA Statement, Notarized letter of administration. Copy of listing agreement w/ list price signed by borrower and agent w/ cancelation verbiage, Realtor license for both parties, and a copy of the Purchase Agreement w/ addendums. \\nXX/XX/XXXX I faxed and emailed PHH the following documents, HARDSHIP AFFIDAVIT, BUYERS MEMBER DOCS, HOA STATEMENT, LISTING AGREEMENT, SALES CONTRACT, HUD1 / SETTLEMENT STATEMENT. The servicer continues to ask for a Notarized Letter of Administration. I have explained to the servicer and the person assigned XXXX XXXX at extension XXXX, that there is no letter of administration because there is no estate or will or probate or even any death in the parties. When I called back on XX/XX/XXXX I was told the docs were received but to allow time for review. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the docs still had not been reviewed yet. I called back again to PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and PHH reviewed the documents and advised we were missing some items. The items missing were listing agreement - Settlement Statement - Sales Contract - Realtor License - I explained this was all sent in on XX/XX/XXXX which they confirmed receipt of on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the following was sent to PHH again, SALES CONTRACT, LISTING AGREEMENT, HUD1 SETTLEMENT STATEMENT, BROKERS LICENSE. I called PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and was told Underwriters are asking for additional docs - Complete and valid listing agreement with list price signed, complete and valid copy of HUD. Need HOA support document for fee showing on HUD. So while on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX I sent the following via Fax and Email to PHH - SALES AGREEMENT, HUD 1/SETTLEMENT STATEMENT, LISTING AGREEMENT, HOA BILL.  On XX/XX/XXXX I sent the following again just to make sure received - LISTING AGREEMENT, SALES CONTRACT, HUD1 SETTLEMENT STATEMENT. On XX/XX/XXXX we received an update from the underwriters - Underwriting team shows the package to be incomplete and need the following documents - Complete and valid listing agreement w/ list price signed by borrowers and listing agent is required, A complete and valid copy of the settlement statement is required, Also a complete and valid copy of the purchase agreement and all addendum is required, please provide a copy of the license for the listing agent and selling agent, Please provide a copy of brokers license Notarized copy of the notarized copy of executor deed. - At this time we explained again that all of this information has been sent in several times and also advised that the Notarized copy of executor deed is not applicable. I also had the Rep on the phone dig into the files that we have submitted. Rep located the Brokers License and documented the page number 24 of document # 116. I went ahead and resent the HOA statement by itself also 3 times back to back just to make sure received. On the XX/XX/XXXX call the rep apparently left a note asking why the Notarized copy of executor deed is being asked if there is no death/probate or estate. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX for an update and was advised the same information is being requested - Complete and valid listing agreement w/ list price signed by borrowers and listing agent is required along with cancelation clause, A complete and valid copy of the settlement statement is required, Also a complete and valid copy of the purchase agreement and all addendum is required, please provide a copy of the license for the listing agent and selling agent, Please provide a copy of brokers license, Notarized copy of the executor deed. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke w/ XXXX the assigned specialist and went over and over about the request that are being made. He mentioned the same items being needed, listing agreement signed and dated by all parties with standard cancelation clause, Sales Agreement singed and dated, HUD1 Settlement Statement, Copy of Brokers License, Notarized copy of Executor Deed. I raised a question about the cancelation clause that is needed and explained we have the cancelation clause on the Listing Agreement on page 8, paragraph 15.  XXXX did not know what verbiage was required and kept asking me to send standard cancelation clause. I explained there is no \" standard '' and the cancelation clause is usually investor specific to the short sale. He didn't know what to advise. We've been going round and round in circles. I spoke w/ XXXX the case manager again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the same information is being requested. listing agreement signed and dated by all parties with standard cancelation clause, Sales Agreement singed and dated, XXXX Settlement Statement, Copy of Brokers License, Notarized copy of Executor Deed. Today XX/XX/XXXX I call PHH and speak to agent ID XXXX and I am told that the Short Sale has been canceled on XX/XX/XXXX due to not receiving the documents in time. Now we have a XX/XX/XXXX FC date and no short sale in review and very low odds of them opening it up for review this close to the foreclosure sale date. I am very frustrated as I feel like I have been jumping through every hoop thrown at me and I am ready to get my attorney involved if need be. I don't like the way PHH is handling my loan and not providing clear details on what is needed based on what has been provided.   \n",

Mr. XXXX responded that he will update me but I never heard from him again until today. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called customer service to close this commercial line of credit account and waiver of {$150.00} fees which the customer service associate sent me form for ( attached here as evidence XXXX and mentioned to write in form requesting waiver in closure form and fax it. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged another {$150.00} fees. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I filled out the form and FAXED as requested by the customer service associate, attached here original faxed form and successful fax transmission receipt. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged additional {$300.00} fees with the future date of XX/XX/XXXX!!! This is the first time I saw in my life future dated fees and clear retaliation to not close my account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up again with customer service and gave reference number XXXX after talking to customer service associate Ms. XXXX XXXX and gave 3 business days to close this account. \\n\\nToday on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw an account not closed yet so I called customer service with a given reference number who said it will take another 2 business days. Also the customer service associate gave me personal banker XXXX XXXX 's phone number. I called XXXX XXXX who informed me he is no longer part of retail and works in merchant services so can not help me and gave me XXXX XXXX 's branch name and branch number. XXXX gave me information on XXXX XXXX who is copied here. \\n\\nI have spent at least 8 hours on chasing Key Bank to close my account which was never used. \\n\\nPlease note I have not used a single dollar from this commercial line of credit in all these years. \\n\\nI hope that this complaint will raise awareness with the government and regulators which will result in overall betterment and stop unlawful and unethical practises. Please feel free to contact me if I can provide additional details or information. \\n\\nSincerely,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the pay stub was received and the foreclosure date was suspended. on XX/XX/XXXX I called and spoke w/ PHH and was told I need to provide XXXX pay stub that reflects the year to date income or the most recent bank statement from 2nd employer. I then Faxed and Emailed the following PAY STUB FROM OTHER EMPLOYER on XX/XX/XXXX. I called PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmed the pay stub was received and under review. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH for an update and was told we have a complete package under review for loan mod before we go into short sale and to allow up to 30 days for a decision. Called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and the file was still under review. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the file was still under review. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the file was still under review. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the file was still under review for a decision and to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX as this will be the 30 day of the review. I called PHH again on XX/XX/XXXX and there was no new info. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and was told that the load mod decision was denied and that we would be moving into short sale review. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and there was no movement or no new info on the loan being reviewed for short sale. On XX/XX/XXXX I called PHH and was told we need the following items - Need a completed Hardship Affidavit - also a copy of buyers member docs, a copy of the HUD1 w/o cash from or to the seller. HOA Statement, Notarized letter of administration. Copy of listing agreement w/ list price signed by borrower and agent w/ cancelation verbiage, Realtor license for both parties, and a copy of the Purchase Agreement w/ addendums. \\nXX/XX/XXXX I faxed and emailed PHH the following documents, HARDSHIP AFFIDAVIT, BUYERS MEMBER DOCS, HOA STATEMENT, LISTING AGREEMENT, SALES CONTRACT, HUD1 / SETTLEMENT STATEMENT. The servicer continues to ask for a Notarized Letter of Administration. I have explained to the servicer and the person assigned XXXX XXXX at extension XXXX, that there is no letter of administration because there is no estate or will or probate or even any death in the parties. When I called back on XX/XX/XXXX I was told the docs were received but to allow time for review. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the docs still had not been reviewed yet. I called back again to PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and PHH reviewed the documents and advised we were missing some items. The items missing were listing agreement - Settlement Statement - Sales Contract - Realtor License - I explained this was all sent in on XX/XX/XXXX which they confirmed receipt of on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the following was sent to PHH again, SALES CONTRACT, LISTING AGREEMENT, HUD1 SETTLEMENT STATEMENT, BROKERS LICENSE. I called PHH on XX/XX/XXXX and was told Underwriters are asking for additional docs - Complete and valid listing agreement with list price signed, complete and valid copy of HUD. Need HOA support document for fee showing on HUD. So while on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX I sent the following via Fax and Email to PHH - SALES AGREEMENT, HUD 1/SETTLEMENT STATEMENT, LISTING AGREEMENT, HOA BILL.  On XX/XX/XXXX I sent the following again just to make sure received - LISTING AGREEMENT, SALES CONTRACT, HUD1 SETTLEMENT STATEMENT. On XX/XX/XXXX we received an update from the underwriters - Underwriting team shows the package to be incomplete and need the following documents - Complete and valid listing agreement w/ list price signed by borrowers and listing agent is required, A complete and valid copy of the settlement statement is required, Also a complete and valid copy of the purchase agreement and all addendum is required, please provide a copy of the license for the listing agent and selling agent, Please provide a copy of brokers license Notarized copy of the notarized copy of executor deed. - At this time we explained again that all of this information has been sent in several times and also advised that the Notarized copy of executor deed is not applicable. I also had the Rep on the phone dig into the files that we have submitted. Rep located the Brokers License and documented the page number 24 of document # 116. I went ahead and resent the HOA statement by itself also 3 times back to back just to make sure received. On the XX/XX/XXXX call the rep apparently left a note asking why the Notarized copy of executor deed is being asked if there is no death/probate or estate. I called PHH back on XX/XX/XXXX for an update and was advised the same information is being requested - Complete and valid listing agreement w/ list price signed by borrowers and listing agent is required along with cancelation clause, A complete and valid copy of the settlement statement is required, Also a complete and valid copy of the purchase agreement and all addendum is required, please provide a copy of the license for the listing agent and selling agent, Please provide a copy of brokers license, Notarized copy of the executor deed. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke w/ XXXX the assigned specialist and went over and over about the request that are being made. He mentioned the same items being needed, listing agreement signed and dated by all parties with standard cancelation clause, Sales Agreement singed and dated, HUD1 Settlement Statement, Copy of Brokers License, Notarized copy of Executor Deed. I raised a question about the cancelation clause that is needed and explained we have the cancelation clause on the Listing Agreement on page 8, paragraph 15.  XXXX did not know what verbiage was required and kept asking me to send standard cancelation clause. I explained there is no \" standard '' and the cancelation clause is usually investor specific to the short sale. He didn't know what to advise. We've been going round and round in circles. I spoke w/ XXXX the case manager again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told the same information is being requested. listing agreement signed and dated by all parties with standard cancelation clause, Sales Agreement singed and dated, XXXX Settlement Statement, Copy of Brokers License, Notarized copy of Executor Deed. Today XX/XX/XXXX I call PHH and speak to agent ID XXXX and I am told that the Short Sale has been canceled on XX/XX/XXXX due to not receiving the documents in time. Now we have a XX/XX/XXXX FC date and no short sale in review and very low odds of them opening it up for review this close to the foreclosure sale date. I am very frustrated as I feel like I have been jumping through every hoop thrown at me and I am ready to get my attorney involved if need be. I don't like the way PHH is handling my loan and not providing clear details on what is needed based on what has been provided.</td>\n",

              "5222   On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX an aggressive and violent tenant, one whom has made multiple physical threats unprovoked and constantly had a man with a known violent criminal record stay with her committed assault and battery against me. The police were called, I had open wounds on my face from where I was clawed and recommended to go to the hospital. I wrote the apartment, XXXX XXXX, a letter and presented proof of the violent assault that took place. As over half a dozen noise complaints had been filed, police have shown up to their residence for unknown reasons, often needing to knock the door down, the threat was forseable. XXXX XXXX violated the terms of our lease agreement and not only failed to provide a quiet and safe environment, but acted negligently in allowing the situation to escalate despite ours and others warnings. Office manager XXXX XXXX agreed. I moved out completely on XX/XX/XXXX and was asked to pay for both XXXX and XXXX rent amounts. As the contract was legally void I offered to not sue for negligence and pay a pro rated amount until XX/XX/XXXX. The keys had been returned to them on XX/XX/XXXX when the incident was reported. I am XXXX and did not leave my apartment unless absolutely necessary. \\n\\nI have not heard a single thing, received for any mail or email or evening phone call since. As of XX/XX/XXXX there is a {$1200.00} collection on my 3 credit reports from FAIR COLLECTIONS & OUT with the only information provided being the name and the amount listed as derogatory. \\n\\nWith absolutely nothing to go on I disputed with the three credit report agencies and they directed me to file a report with the FTC. I have done all that I was asked to, sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX to the debt collector that was generated by the FTC. By this time I had found an address after XXXX the information. No email or phone number were provided to me to this day. \\n\\nThey have not reached back out to me, but they have responded to the disputes I filed with the reporting agencies regarding their accuracy and requesting information be sent to me at my provided home address. \\n\\nThey added an account number and date of first delinquency : XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe letter is very detailed and in each dispute I made with all three credit reporting agencies I made it clear I have never been notified of any past due amount, sent a bill, or contacted about this. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX employees have been a nightmare to deal with when I did live there. After my last contact with them I do not want further contact, and will have to sue for Negligence and fraud by early XXXX if no one will actually verify they contacted me, or made any attempt to contact me as if they had I would have responded before this became a legal issue I cant afford with this epidemic living in XXXX.   \n",
              "10312  I took a personal loan out with Ally Bank through XXXX XXXX XXXX in the beginning of XXXX. I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX that my first payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I made my first payment on that date. A few days later I received an email that there was an error and my first payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I made my payment of the due date that I was told. The end of XXXX I received notification that my payment was late. I called and explained the situation and was told the late fee will be reversed. XXXX I made my normal payment and a few days later I received another notification that my payment was late. When I called customer service I was told my request was denied and i will have to pay the late payment. I explained that is is a financial burden because i am on a fixed income. I work part time but because of Covid my job is shut down. Now the late payment is doubled since I did not make the first late payment. I tried to explain that this was an error on their part so why should i be punished But they dont want to listen. I am at my wits end.

I wrote the apartment, XXXX XXXX, a letter and presented proof of the violent assault that took place. As over half a dozen noise complaints had been filed, police have shown up to their residence for unknown reasons, often needing to knock the door down, the threat was forseable. XXXX XXXX violated the terms of our lease agreement and not only failed to provide a quiet and safe environment, but acted negligently in allowing the situation to escalate despite ours and others warnings. Office manager XXXX XXXX agreed. I moved out completely on XX/XX/XXXX and was asked to pay for both XXXX and XXXX rent amounts. As the contract was legally void I offered to not sue for negligence and pay a pro rated amount until XX/XX/XXXX. The keys had been returned to them on XX/XX/XXXX when the incident was reported.

I have done all that I was asked to, sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX to the debt collector that was generated by the FTC. By this time I had found an address after XXXX the information. No email or phone number were provided to me to this day. \\n\\nThey have not reached back out to me, but they have responded to the disputes I filed with the reporting agencies regarding their accuracy and requesting information be sent to me at my provided home address. \\n\\nThey added an account number and date of first delinquency : XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe letter is very detailed and in each dispute I made with all three credit reporting agencies I made it clear I have never been notified of any past due amount, sent a bill, or contacted about this. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX employees have been a nightmare to deal with when I did live there. After my last contact with them I do not want further contact, and will have to sue for Negligence and fraud by early XXXX if no one will actually verify they contacted me, or made any attempt to contact me as if they had I would have responded before this became a legal issue I cant afford with this epidemic living in XXXX.</td>\n",

And per Kohls XXXX XXXX XXXX Department they simply can not give it to me as they don't have it nor does any person ( s ) or establishments will have that information either.</td>\n",

On XX/XX/2021 sent certified letter to Ideal Collections to validate the Debt that was they were reporting only to XXXX on my Credit report, from the beginning this account is not in compliance with XXXX XXXX reporting. Ideal Collections is the Data Furnisher and they are reporting inaccurate, erroneous and missing information. I received a copy of a lease along with a letter stating that they had noted my account as disputed. ( See copies of credit report at the time I requested validation, copy of letter requesting validation and copy of letter stating account will be marked as disputed. ) On XX/XX/2021 I sent another certified letter to Ideal Collections informing them I have retained a copy of their signature and date of receipt, as well as a time-stamped copy of my credit reports, showing that you have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ) and/or the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Section 807 ( 8 ) by not placing the disclosure within the required 30-day period. ( see copy of letter, copy of report showing account is not marked as disputed with XXXX. This account was added to XXXX and XXXX now all 3 bureaus is furnishing inaccurate, erroneous and missing information. My guess is it was added to XXXX and XXXX as some type of punishment. The important thing is there are willful and continuous violations being done by Ideal Collection Service. On XX/XX/2021 sent certified letter to Ideal Collections requesting Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. My request was ignored. ( See attached copy of certified letter sent, copy of Ideal Collections to the 3 bureaus for the month of XXXX reporting. Still a pattern of will non -compliance of XXXX  XXXX and all 3 bureaus not marked as disputed.

              "14507  Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA,  FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. \\n\\n\\n1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.\\n\\n2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.\\n\\n3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.\\n\\n4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.\\n\\n5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.\\n\\n6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..   \n",
              "1473   I have an account with PayPal and PayPal credit. I get my statements emailed to me each month, and pay the \" balance needed to avoid fees ''. I recently received a statement with a late fee of {$39.00}. I pay directly from my bank, XXXX to PayPal. XXXX shows that it takes two days to process. I went online to check my PayPal account, and searched my transactions going back to the beginning of the year. There are no late fees posted on line. I called PayPal and reviewed my statements and PayPal has been posting my transactions a day after the \" due by date ''. They blame the bank. \\n\\nThe reason for my complaint is that I check my transactions online. They do not post late fees online, only on the physical paper statement which I don't check. I know this is my fault. I reviewed the account statements with the customer service representative and it turns out four times this year my payment was posted a day late and I was charged a {$39.00} late fee on four separate occasions. None of these late fees appear on my PayPal activity. Had they posted the late fees online, I would surely have seen this. \\n\\nWhile I take full responsibility for my actions and not checking my paper statement each month, the fact that they knowingly do not post these fees on my online statement activity leads me to believe that this could be a large problem for many other people. \\n\\nI feel that this is a fraudulent attempt by PayPal to charge fees that their users who rely predominantly on \" on-line '' statements will not see.

              "19457  XX/XX/2021 To whom it may concern, I am writing you to request that you update my credit file to accurately report my payment history. I have excellent payment history and I have NEVER been late on a payment any other time then this situation. I paid Honda on time, but my payment was sent back due to insufficient funds. I just purchased a house and expenses that I was not aware of cleared my account, causing this payment to be denied. Honda did NOT contact me to notify me, and I noticed when I logged in to the portal to check my balance history. I tried to make a payment and received an error message telling me that a one-time payment could not be made at that time. I looked at my next scheduled payment ( my payments are set up to be automatic ) and it was including the other payment, so I just left it as it was since it would not be past the 30 days past due. \\nI then received a call from someone at Honda trying to collect on the balance and I told them that I tried to make the payment but was told I could not make a one-time payment and that the balance showed that it was going to be deducted automatically in just a few days with my current payment. I asked if this payment could just be made then since it was already set up, and he said it was. \\nThe date that my payment normally would be auto deducted came and went and I noticed that the payment never came out of my account, so I logged in and tried to make both payments and was give the same error message again that said a one-time payment could not be made. I tried again the next day and was given the same error message. I called several times with long wait times before I finally was able to speak with a live agent who told me that the reason that I was not able to make the payments online was because they had suspended my ability to pay online and suspended my ACH payments due to the payment being returned, but no one informed me of this. Again, I spoke to another person before this and not one time did, he say that the payment would not be made as it showed scheduled and that I would not be able to pay online even though I mentioned the error message when I tried to make the payment and asked him if my payments would be okay and on time if they were just taken on the day that they were scheduled. \\nI made several attempts to make this payment on time and would have gladly paid it when the first person called me if I knew I had to make my payment with a rep. I tried making it just days before online. This is unfair to ruin my perfect payment history when the ability to pay was taken away from me and Honda never took the ACH when it was scheduled. I should have been contacted and informed that my payment ability and my ACH payments were suspended and if I had been this would have been taken care of timely and I would have called to make a payment. \\nPlease remove this from my credit report. \\n\\nThank you, XXXX XXXX Your Report Number is : XXXX XXXX XXXX

              "12361  This is XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is submitting this CFPB complaint myself, and to inform you that there is no third party involved in the process. My request for the correction and removable of the erroneous information about my inquiries has been diligently neglected by Equifax. Despite sending them the last letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, for the said request, I have not received any response up to this date. Besides, the inaccurate information about my inquiries is still on my reports. Therefore, Equifax has not complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC Sections 1681i within the time permitted by law and continued reporting as unverified information which now, given all my attempts to address it directly with the creditor, as willful negligence and non-compliance with federal statutes.

              "      <td>Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the \" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. \\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA,  FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. \\n\\n\\n1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.\\n\\n2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.\\n\\n3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.\\n\\n4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.\\n\\n5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.\\n\\n6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..</td>\n",

I recently received a statement with a late fee of {$39.00}. I pay directly from my bank, XXXX to PayPal. XXXX shows that it takes two days to process. I went online to check my PayPal account, and searched my transactions going back to the beginning of the year. There are no late fees posted on line. I called PayPal and reviewed my statements and PayPal has been posting my transactions a day after the \" due by date ''. They blame the bank. \\n\\nThe reason for my complaint is that I check my transactions online. They do not post late fees online, only on the physical paper statement which I don't check. I know this is my fault. I reviewed the account statements with the customer service representative and it turns out four times this year my payment was posted a day late and I was charged a {$39.00} late fee on four separate occasions. None of these late fees appear on my PayPal activity. Had they posted the late fees online, I would surely have seen this. \\n\\nWhile I take full responsibility for my actions and not checking my paper statement each month, the fact that they knowingly do not post these fees on my online statement activity leads me to believe that this could be a large problem for many other people. \\n\\nI feel that this is a fraudulent attempt by PayPal to charge fees that their users who rely predominantly on \" on-line '' statements will not see.</td>\n",

I have excellent payment history and I have NEVER been late on a payment any other time then this situation. I paid Honda on time, but my payment was sent back due to insufficient funds. I just purchased a house and expenses that I was not aware of cleared my account, causing this payment to be denied. Honda did NOT contact me to notify me, and I noticed when I logged in to the portal to check my balance history. I tried to make a payment and received an error message telling me that a one-time payment could not be made at that time. I looked at my next scheduled payment ( my payments are set up to be automatic ) and it was including the other payment, so I just left it as it was since it would not be past the 30 days past due. \\nI then received a call from someone at Honda trying to collect on the balance and I told them that I tried to make the payment but was told I could not make a one-time payment and that the balance showed that it was going to be deducted automatically in just a few days with my current payment. I asked if this payment could just be made then since it was already set up, and he said it was. \\nThe date that my payment normally would be auto deducted came and went and I noticed that the payment never came out of my account, so I logged in and tried to make both payments and was give the same error message again that said a one-time payment could not be made. I tried again the next day and was given the same error message. I called several times with long wait times before I finally was able to speak with a live agent who told me that the reason that I was not able to make the payments online was because they had suspended my ability to pay online and suspended my ACH payments due to the payment being returned, but no one informed me of this. Again, I spoke to another person before this and not one time did, he say that the payment would not be made as it showed scheduled and that I would not be able to pay online even though I mentioned the error message when I tried to make the payment and asked him if my payments would be okay and on time if they were just taken on the day that they were scheduled. \\nI made several attempts to make this payment on time and would have gladly paid it when the first person called me if I knew I had to make my payment with a rep. I tried making it just days before online. This is unfair to ruin my perfect payment history when the ability to pay was taken away from me and Honda never took the ACH when it was scheduled. I should have been contacted and informed that my payment ability and my ACH payments were suspended and if I had been this would have been taken care of timely and I would have called to make a payment. \\nPlease remove this from my credit report. \\n\\nThank you, XXXX XXXX Your Report Number is : XXXX XXXX XXXX</td>\n",
